git clone <repository-url>
cd datamart
```

---

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend folder and install dependencies.

```
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

### 3️⃣ Start the Development Server

```
npm run dev
```

The app will start at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

# 📦 Environment Variables

If the backend API runs on a different port, create a `.env` file.

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

# 📊 Application Pages

## Dashboard

The dashboard displays:

* Product statistics
* Search functionality
* Paginated product list
* Sidebar navigation

---

## Product Detail

Each product has a dedicated page displaying:

* Product name
* Category
* Price
* Description

The page is loaded dynamically using route parameters.

---

# 🔎 Search Feature

Users can search products by name.
Search results update dynamically using API requests.

---

# 📄 Pagination

Pagination is implemented to improve performance and usability when dealing with large datasets.

Users can navigate between pages of products easily.

---

# ⚡ Performance Optimizations

## Lazy Loading

The application uses **React.lazy** and **Suspense** for route-based code splitting.

Example:

```
const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import("./pages/Dashboard"));
const ProductDetail = React.lazy(() => import("./pages/ProductDetail"));
```

Benefits:

* Smaller initial bundle size
* Faster initial page load
* Components loaded only when needed

---

## Memoization

Product cards are wrapped with **React.memo** to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

```
export default React.memo(ProductCard);
```

---

# 🎨 UI & Styling

The UI is built using **Tailwind CSS**.

Features include:

* Responsive layout
* Hover animations
* Modern dashboard layout

---
 
# 🔄 Data Fetching

Data is fetched using **Axios**.

Example:

```
axios.get("/products")
```

A custom hook `useProducts` handles:

* API calls
* Loading state
* Product data

---

# 📱 Responsive Design

The dashboard is fully responsive and works across:

* Desktop
* Tablet
* Mobile

---

# 📌 Future Improvements

Possible enhancements for future versions:

* Product creation and editing
* Authentication
* Advanced analytics
* Charts and graphs
* Product images
* Export reports
